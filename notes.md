# Notes

- White surfaces -> high reflectivity, get the most out of the light, reduce light extinction.
- Growing medium/substrate/compost -> what the plant is growing in

- Hydroponic farming - growing food without soil, the plants roots are continuously immersed in water
- Aeroponics - similar setup to hydroponic systems, but the water is pressurised and fired over the plants in a mist
- Both hydroponics and aeroponics both need some nutrients solution, is this mixed with the water?
- Aquaponics - growing plants similar to hydroponics but without the need for added nutrients, the system is in a closed loop with a fish tank or something that produces the nutrients needed.
- Need to work out the medium to hold the seeds, even if the roots are suspended in air/water [some examples here](http://www.homehydrosystems.com/mediums/mediums_page.html)
